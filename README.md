## Introduction
I had seen various chat application projects and tutorials in github ,youtube ,and other online resources. But in most of them it was a room where people can enter and chat, and security feature was not that good. So I decided to develop a chat application in django where one-to-one chat or private chat is possible keeping in mind the security features.

I had faced some difficulties while developing this application. I will brief about them and how to install it in your local system and run it in development server. The link to youtube video for deployment to heroku is provided [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkokhawLKDU&list=WL&index=39).

## Prerequisites(Optional)
As this is web application you can use it by simply visiting this link<b>:</b>[https://chitprivatechatapp.herokuapp.com/](https://chitprivatechatapp.herokuapp.com/).<br><br>
 But as a developer you might be interested to work on it or see it running in your local system. For that 
 you must have python installed in your system and all evironments settings done properly. Don't know how to install it ,see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQlmeJnPg) tutorial video for reference.
## Installation and Setup(Optional)
First clone this repository to your local machine using the following command in git bash<b>:</b>
```
$ git clone [URL]
```
Now open git bash in the root directory of the repository and enter the following command to install the required dependencies<b>:</b>
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
Inside the privatechat directory there is another directory named privatechat which is the django project directory. We have to make a few changes to /settings.py file in this directory.

First create a new google account and turn on less secure app permissions.See [this](https://devanswers.co/allow-less-secure-apps-access-gmail-account/) for reference.

Now in /settings.py file find the below code<b>:</b>
```
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'Replace with google account you just created'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'Replace with password of your google account'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
```
Replace the required fields as mentioned in the above code.

Now we are almost done, we have just one more setting to do and the most tricky one.<br><br>
We will work on setting up django google drive storage. To use this storage you have to<b>:</b>
 * [set up a project and application in the Google Developers Console for newly created google account](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive)
 * [obtain the json private key file (OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications) for your Google Project associated with Google Drive service](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account)

Put the downloaded json private key file inside the privatechat directory present in the root directory of the repository.


Find the below code in /settings.py file<b>:</b>
```
GOOGLE_DRIVE_STORAGE_JSON_KEY_FILE = os.path.join(BASE_DIR , "Replace with name of your json private key file")
```
So we are done‚úå. Just few more steps to get it running in local server.

## Running in the local server(Optional)
Open the git bash inside the privatechat directory present in the root directory of the repository.
Run the following commands in order one by one:
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver
```
Follow the link generated after last command and Hurrah!üéâ the app is running.

## Deploying the app to heroku(Optional)
Now although it's running good in local server but to deploy to heroku we have to make few more changes. Refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkokhawLKDU&list=WL&index=39) tutorial for detailed step by step deployment to heroku.
